        <p>
            This game is my own design. Although the game is titled Gem Jam,
            there are no gem graphics yet. This demo uses the minimal graphics
            needed to experience game play. For testing purposes I may alter how
            the game works without warning as this version is the same one I use
            when trying to improve the game. <b>This game must be connected to
            the Internet in order for it to load puzzles.</b> So if you download
            it, it will not play offline.
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            This game can run on any device that has the HTML5 specification on
            the web browser, specifically with the canvas element. This includes
            desktop/laptop computers, tablets and smart phones. Be sure your
            web browser is up to date.
        </p>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Every gem (represented by filled colored squares) must go within the
            same color zone (represented by a colored square outline) of that
            gem. Once this is done, the game will display a button on the right
            saying "finished". Tapping that button will bring you to the next
            puzzle.
        </p>
        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            Gems can be moved by drawing strait lines across columns or rows.
            All gems move together when on the same column or row when swiped or
            drawn up/down or left/right. Gems can only stay on the rail. If any
            of the gems cannot move forward because of lack of rail or too many
            on the rail, none of them will move.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first few puzzles have text hints on the top left.</li>
            <li>If you find your gems are stuck, look around and see what gem(s) are preventing movement.</li>
            <li>You often have to move gems out of their zones temporarily in order to put other gems in their place.</li>
            <li>Don't be intimidated too easily by some of the puzzles, they can be easier than they look.</li>
        </ul>
